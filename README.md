# Email-Extract - Tool for extracting emails from enumerated websites!

Email-Extract is a simple tool I wrote to help extract emails from websites for OSINT research. Simply enumerate it with a common tool like *dirb* or *wfuzz* and in the output file add '(CODE:200)'. The file will then be parsed and scanned for emails, of course you can automatically enumerate the site with *dirb* with my tool as well.

## Getting Started

To begin, run ``` sudo ./main.py ``` or ``` sudo python3 main.py ``` and follow the instructions to begin extracting emails!
